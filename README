Usage: ./android-text-localizer.py <android layout file> <strings xml file>

Recommended you install python-lxml, but this script should still work with
nearly any Python installation.

IMO, one of the most annoying things about Android is its insistence that
developers localize strings by referencing the strings in layouts using @string
and placing the actual string in res/values/strings.xml.

This script does that for you automatically. It will parse a layout file for
any element with an android:text attribute. If that attribute has not already
been localized, it generates the correct <string> element and writes it to the
strings XML file. It will also re-write the layout file to use the new <string>
element.

The name of the string is the android:id of the element it came from. If the
element doesn't have an android:id, a random string is used. If the name is
duplicated in the strings.xml, a random string is appended.

Errors and warnings are printed at the end of processing.
